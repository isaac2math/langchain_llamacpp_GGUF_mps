The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal against the sentence of imprisonment imposed on Hami Qutami for soliciting to murder. The Court set aside a non-parole period of 11 months and 21 days and fixed a new non-parole period of 29 months and 21 days commencing on 8 March 2001 and ending on 28 August 2003

The victim, Ruba Qutami, was a 20-year-old Christian woman who had left her family and moved in with Haytham, her Muslim boyfriend. Her family did not approve of their relationship and put pressure on her to return home. When she refused, they threatened her and eventually tried to forcibly take her back. She obtained an Apprehended Violence Order against her father, mother, and brother, Nashat.

Ruba was pregnant at the time and her family became aware of her condition. In August 1998, she moved into Haytham's father's house in Bonnyrigg with him. The police were concerned for their safety and helped them to find alternative accommodation.

Meanwhile, Ruba's uncle, the prisoner, telephoned Mr P J Jumeau, a director of Southern Cross Investigations, and enquired how much it would cost to have Ruba killed because she had "moved out with a Muslim." He added that they wanted to get rid of her "totally."

The police were notified, and they installed a tape recorder on Mr Jumeau's telephone. The prisoner arranged to meet Mr Jumeau at the Cafe Paye lla in Liverpool Street. They discussed the matter further, and the prisoner explained that Ruba had left home with her boyfriend and was living with him in his father's house. He also mentioned her going to the police and taking out an Apprehended Violence Order against her family members.

The conversation continued with the prisoner explaining what he wanted Mr Jumeau to do: "When I talk to you on the telephone about taking care of it, kidnapping or whatever you like, get rid of her completely." The prisoner meant that Ruba should be killed, and he did not specify how this was to be done. He also stated that he knew some people who could help with the matter.

Mr Jumeau asked if he meant "shooting" Ruba, to which the prisoner replied: "You do, I don't know which way you do it." Mr Jumeau further clarified if the prisoner meant that any method was acceptable, and the prisoner replied: "That's right. The reason I told you the whole situation is that I know some people who say because of the apprehended violence order against her father."

The police had been monitoring the conversation and subsequently arrested the prisoner for soliciting to murder Ruba Qutami

The summary of the above is that the prisoner planned to harm his daughter's ex-husband by paying someone to do so. He approached a man named Jumeau who agreed to help him find a hitman. Jumeau recorded their conversations and gave them to the police. The judge considered a variety of reports, including medical reports and psychologist's reports, before sentencing the prisoner to 12 years in prison for conspiracy to commit murder. A man was sentenced to 12 years in jail after he solicited someone to murder his daughter's ex-husband. The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the original sentence and imposed a new one
